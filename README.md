# ▶️ Executing Python Scripts

This project consists of multiple independent Python scripts used for cryptocurrency data processing, scraping, and environmental damage analysis. **All scripts may be executed in any order with one critical exception:**  
**`damages_script.py` must always be executed last**, as it depends on outputs generated by the other scripts.

---

## Script Descriptions

### `asic_miner.py`
This script scrapes the ASIC Miner Value website and builds a clean table of **Bitcoin ASIC miners** only. It filters the full profitability table down to Bitcoin-focused devices using the “Top” column where available, or by detecting the SHA-256 algorithm as a fallback. For each miner it extracts manufacturer, model, release date, hashrate, power draw, algorithm, raw price/profit strings, and parsed numeric fields, then writes the result to `bitcoin_asic_miners.csv`. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

### `pandas_read_table_mining.py`
This script pulls mining hardware comparison tables directly from the Bitcoin Wiki using `pandas.read_html`. It locates the main summary table containing the “Product” column, renames key columns to cleaner snake-case labels, and standardizes messy numeric values by stripping footnotes, commas, and non-numeric characters. The cleaned dataset, including metrics such as advertised Mhash/s, efficiency, watts, and price, is saved to `bitcoin_mining_hardware_summary_clean.csv` for downstream analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

### `scraper_asic_all_coins.py`
This script queries ASIC Miner Value for multiple “Top Coin” filters (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin/Dogecoin, Monero, ZCash) to collect ASIC miner listings by coin. For each coin it parses the main miners table, capturing model name, release date, hashrate, power consumption, algorithm, textual best price and profit fields, plus parsed USD price and daily profitability. The outputs are per-coin DataFrames (and CSVs) that can also be combined into a wide dataset of ASIC hardware characteristics and economics across supported cryptocurrencies. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

### `hashrates_crypto_process.py`
This script scrapes **daily network hashrates** for multiple cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Dash, ZCash, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold, Dogecoin, Vertcoin) from BitInfoCharts. It parses the embedded Dygraph data, normalizes dates, and builds a unified DataFrame indexed from 2015-01-01 to the present with one column per coin, filling missing values with zeros. The script saves the full panel to `hashrates_2015_to_present_bitinfocharts.csv`, generates individual PNG time-series plots for each coin, and creates a composite multi-coin hashrate figure for comparison. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

### `block_time_crypto_process.py`
This script is structurally similar to the hashrate processor, but targets **average block confirmation time** per block for the same set of cryptocurrencies. It scrapes BitInfoCharts’ confirmation-time comparison pages, converts the Dygraph JavaScript arrays to clean date–value pairs, and assembles a daily panel from 2015-01-01 onward with confirmation times (in minutes) for each coin. The results are stored in `confirmation_time_per_block_2015_to_present_bitinfocharts.csv` and visualized through per-coin PNG plots plus a composite multi-coin block-time figure. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

### `price_crypto_process.py`
This script downloads **historical market prices** (in USD) for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Dash, ZCash, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold, Dogecoin, and Vertcoin using BitInfoCharts’ price comparison pages. It extracts the Dygraph time-series data, normalizes the date formats, and constructs a daily panel where each column is a coin’s price and missing days are filled with zeros. The script writes the combined dataset to `market_price_2015_to_present_bitinfocharts.csv` and produces individual PNG price charts for each cryptocurrency over the full sample period. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

### `wide_coin_script.py`
This script also focuses on price data, but uses a more regex-driven parser to read Dygraph arrays for each coin’s daily USD price from the BitInfoCharts “all-time” comparison pages. It builds separate DataFrames for each asset, merges them into a **wide** table with columns `date | Bitcoin | Litecoin | ... | Vertcoin`, and sorts the data chronologically. The final wide price panel is exported as `daily_prices_2015_2025.csv` for use in downstream modeling or visualization notebooks. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

### `reward_per_block.py`
This script hits each coin’s main BitInfoCharts page to parse the **current block reward**, decomposing it into subsidy and average fee components. It searches for the “Reward Per Block” line, extracts the numeric subsidy and (if present) the additional fee amount, and computes the total reward per block. The resulting DataFrame, indexed by ticker and including the source URL, is printed to the console and saved to `block_rewards_snapshot_bitinfocharts.csv` for documentation and later analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

### `damages_script.py`
This is the primary **Cryptocurrency Environmental Damage Index (CEDI)** pipeline that orchestrates data collection, transformation, modeling, and visualization. It uses Digiconomist’s JSON API to fetch daily energy and emissions statistics for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, combines them with BitInfoCharts market prices, confirmation times, and Bitcoin supply data, and then computes per-day energy costs, CO₂ emissions, social-cost-of-carbon damages, and derived CEDI_t and CEDI-as-%-of-price metrics for each coin. The script saves cleaned CSVs, generates multiple timeseries plots (per-coin and cross-coin), and fits both ARIMA and ETS forecasting models to CEDI_t to produce 6-month baseline and “innovation” scenarios, along with forecast metrics and visualization files. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
